# Plant Disease Classification

## Intro
This project is a machine learning-powered web application designed to identify diseases in plants based on leaf images. By analyzing visual patterns in leaves, it helps farmers, botanists, and researchers quickly detect issues and take action.
## Data Source
The dataset used is available on Kaggle. You can find the dataset and additional information [here.]()

## About Data
The dataset contains:
+ Multiple plant species (e.g., Tomato, Apple, Potato)
+ Healthy and diseased leaf samples
+ Labeled classes for various plant diseases such as blight, rust, and mildew
+ RGB images resized and augmented for better model generalization
